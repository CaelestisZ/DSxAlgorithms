# Data Structures & Algorithms
Core concepts in DS and Algorithms coded in C 🐱‍👤

## Stack & Heap memory

 - **Stack**
    - Used up for statically allocated memory
    - Organized manner
 - **Heap**
    - Used up for dynamically allocated memory
    - Unorganized manner
    - Must be treated as a resource

## Physical & Logical data structures

 - **Physical data structures**
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
 - **Logical data structures** are implemented using physical data structures
    - Stack (linear)
    - Queue (linear)
    - Tree (non linear)
    - Graph (non linear)
    - Hash table (tables)

## Recursion vs loops

 - Recursion has an ascending as well as a descending phase considering the recursion stack
 - Loops have only an ascending phase

## Types of recursion

 - **Tail recursion**
 - **Head recursion** 
 - **Tree recursion** 
 - **Indirect recursion**
 - **Direct recursion**
